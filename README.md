html5bootstrap
==============

A ready-to-code set of files to begin coding right away with all the tools the open source community to offer in its great generosity.

# Why node ?

Because it is fun and because it is really simple to install and make it work.

# If node cannot be used ?

I just use the `public` directory and put it in the DocumentRoot directory of the virtualhost

# Usage

```
$ git clone https://github.com/laruiss/html5bootstrap

$ cd html5bootstrap

$ npm install

$ nmp start
```

And then go to http://localhost:8007 with your browser
